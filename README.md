## Summary:
This was an interesting project and learned a lot.  One of the drawbacks that I saw from a user perspective is there is nothing in place to notify whether or not a parameter like, date, city, or country that is entered is valid.  To address this there are a couple of approaches that could be implemented.  The first being error messaging.  If an user inputs and invalid date, city, country or shape or the input does not exist, a message should return stating that the "Input entered by the user does not exist, please modify your input and try again".  A second option is to offer to return data based on a date range, or a radius.  If the user of the website did not put in a location that is present in the list of available data, it could return filtered data based on dates plus or minus seven days or if a city that is inputed by the user does not return an exact match then a radius option can be selected to return locations within the selected radius.
